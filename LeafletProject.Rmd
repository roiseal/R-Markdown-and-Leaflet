#### Project Submission Description

Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

#### Project Objective

Show NJ (USA) Student body counts per major race categories, summarized by County
Ranking done by largest total count of Students.


```{R,echo = FALSE ,warning = FALSE}
##-- Load Library, set environment, populate date

library(leaflet)

setwd("~/Documents/Leaflet")
leafloadfile <- read.table("School Data with LL.csv", header = TRUE, sep=";")
njcountydataset <- data.frame(leafloadfile)

##-- Concatenate Content for popup information (summary numbers for NJ County Student  statistics

leafpopup<-paste("County -", njcountydataset$County,
"County_Seat -",njcountydataset$County_Seat,
"White Students -",njcountydataset$White,
"Black Students -",njcountydataset$Black,
"Hispanic Students -",njcountydataset$Hispanic,
sep = " ")
 
leaflables <- paste(njcountydataset$County,"-", njcountydataset$Total)
##-- Map it 

njcountydataset  %>%
  leaflet()  %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(lng=njcountydataset$longitude, lat=njcountydataset$latitude,  popup = leafpopup) %>%
  addCircles(lng=njcountydataset$longitude, lat=njcountydataset$latitude, weight = 1, radius = sqrt(njcountydataset$Total) * 50)  %>%
  addLegend( title = "NJ Counties Total Students" ,  colors = njcountydataset$Total /200000, labels=leaflables)
     
```
